Light Bot is a fun game that helps me problem-solve and learn the basics of coding robots. Game wise, it is a very simple game. But while playing the game, it gets harder and harder each level you pass through, and it often makes you frustrated. But even with the frustration, it helps me overcome solutions and learn more about simple coding. 
The concept of Light Bot and simple coding can help me prepare for the real coding I will be working on with real robots and it will help me become a better problem solver. Since the first Light Bot game was created by a highschooler, it will inspire me to do well in this class while I work with real robots. It will also help with with my end of the year project in my Robotics class. By learning basic coding, it can help me give me an idea of what I can make my robot do. LightBot also is ment to teach with sequences, overloading, procedures, recursive loops, and conditionals in programing. 


I also tried the program RoboMind. Robomind is similar to Light Bot, but simpler. But both programs help users get an understanding of what robotics is and how to use code. Although the codes are simple and given, it gives the user of sense of what coding is. After completing RoboMind, it helped me gain ideas of what I can make my robot do (a service) for my end of the year project. Mabey I can make my robot pick up something and deliver it to another spot. RoboMind gave me inspiration for that.
