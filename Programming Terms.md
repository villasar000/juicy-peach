<b>Loop Definition</b>

- A loop in programming is a sequence of instructions that is repeated until a certain condition is met. Loops can help coding be done faster until the task is completed.

<b>Function Definition</b>

- A function in programming is a group of instructions, that when put together, performs a specific tasks. Functions can be reusable, once defined, and makes coding easier and faster; it helps to not write down each code every single time, and you can just add a function to your program. 

<b>Conditional Definition</b>

- A conditional in programming is a statement that performs different actions depending on whether a programmer specified a boolean condition to be true or false. For example, in video games, if a player gathers 100 points, a smiley face would pop up on screen, and if the 100 points are not met, nothing would happen. A conditional are if and then statements that help programs run many different types of actions.
